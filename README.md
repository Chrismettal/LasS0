# What is this?

This is a logic level impulse to S0 converter/interface board. It is used to convert 5v logic level impulses to an S0 compatible format to use sensors like the TCRT5000 reflective optical sensor in existing smart home systems, that usually use 12v or 24v levels for digital inputs. This can be used to read out old school electrical meters as well as modern smart meters that only offer optical IR impulses or a spinning disc to "display" the current power usage.
